When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It is a good idea to keep a backup copy of your code on some external storage.  It is also 
  useful for sharing code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you manually make changes it gives you the oppertunity to make sure your code is stable and the save/commit point is locical.
