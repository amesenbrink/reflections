When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It is a good idea to keep a backup copy of your code on some external storage.  It is also 
  useful for sharing code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you manually make changes it gives you the oppertunity to make sure your code is stable and the save/commit point a logical change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a Github option, and it is used to instead of clone to make a new copy of a project.
  A clone is a copy of a probjet and it is useful for pulling a project to a new computer, or pushing to a
    remote repository other than github.
  A branch is a copy of the code that is used to investigate other options or features, it is not a full copy of all the current changes in the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  The benifit to keeping the last known state local is so that you can revert changes if you need to, or 
  even do a fast forward merge.
